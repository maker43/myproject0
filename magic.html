          <p class="txt">For over fifty years, Belgrade has provided a constant source of inspiration for the writer and painter Momo Kapor. In hisstories, essays and sketches, as well as in the highly refined strokes of his pen, he has been trying to discover wht it is that actually constitutes the magic of Belgrade. This book consists of stories and fragments, of anecdotes and of strange biographies of the inhabitants of this city which have beene selected from a few of the forty-plus books produced by this author of bestsellers translated into numerous languages. All these texts attempt to determine what it is that makes this city different from others - in a nutshell, what is that thing known as the spirit of Belgrade.

          "Once upon a time, they say...<br> <br>
          A man was selling his house for three thousand (whichever money was back then). “But the house is not worth more than a thousand!” -  protested the buyer, but the owned replied that a house indeed is worth only a thousands, but that right neighbor is worth one thousand and the right one also! 
          <br>In New York, for example, you can rarely see on entry doors of some apartment a plate with the name. Apartments are always labeled with numbers: D-16, C-24, F-18, …
          There I have never managed to meet my neighbor. Anyways how to tell a kid: “Run to C-25 and borrow a cup of oil “. Truth to be told there no one comes to the point that he has no more oil.
          Regarding us, we have been raised borrowing from neighbors’ vinegar, yeast, eggs, little sugar, bread or tools… In Belgrade, in every kitchen of ours, there are at least two neighbors’ plates, pot or grater, that we haven’t returned yet. 
          Somebody is at the door: “Mother has sent “apples in a dressing gown” “. Good neighborhood customs prescribe that you never return an empty pot after you have received something in it. So in that pot in which we have received “apples in a dressing gown” we put inside, asap, three pieces of “lazy pie”.
          When we have them, neighbors are much closer to us then relatives. Because we chose them by ourselves – relatives we haven’t!!!
          Neighbors have known every little thing we had in our house; in front of them there was nothing to be ashamed of there was nothing to be hidden from them. We left them keys from our home over the summer so they can water the flowers and feed the birds.
